A method for organ and tissue doses estimation from diagnostic chest CT, also applicable to CT units of multi-modality systems, will be developed in Subtask 2.1.2. Using the same MC platform, the current subtask aims for a patientspecific organ dose estimation from a) cone-beam CT scanners used in multi-modality systems and b) CT scanners dedicated to attenuation correction and anatomic localization. This will focus on the most frequently used chest CT protocols and those with the highest contribution to the collective dose to patients in PET/CT and SPECT/CT identified in Subtask 2.3.1. A retrospective study will be conducted based on chest CT examinations performed on at least 200 adults. As in 2.1.2, using anonymised patient CT images as input volume, 3D patient models will be created for each patient. 3D dose distributions will be generated for the most important CT protocols used in PET/CT and SPECT/CT. MC simulations will be performed using an equipment-specific and patient-specific Monte Carlo code (ImpactMC). At least 5 modern CT scanners will be modelled. The scanners' geometry, X-ray spectrum, composition and dimensions of the filters will be taken into account for the simulation. Normalized to CTDIvol organ absorbed doses will be determined for all radiosensitive organs within the primary exposed volume. The latter data will serve as a basis for patient-specific organ doses estimates, taking into account patients’ body size. The resulting dose estimations will be essential novel information for dose optimisation of chest PET/CT and SPECT/CT procedures in 2.3.2.3, benefit-to-risk evaluation, epidemiological research and for modelling of radiation-induced cancer risk."</span></li>

This will involve the conduct of a prospective study on consenting patients to acquire the necessary data to estimate the absorbed organ doses they received from these tracers while undergoing diagnostic scans in nuclear medicine. Protocol development, ethics submission and request for regulatory approval will commence following successful evaluation of this proposal. Research sites will be required to have obtained ethical and management approval and undertake a site initiation meeting prior to opening to recruitment. Once these have been obtained, recruitment of patients will commence among patients referred to nuclear medicine in routine clinical practice. Potential study subjects will be approached, informed about the study and asked whether they wish to participate in the study. Those who accept will be asked to sign an informed consent form. The aim is to recruit at least 25 participants. The study will not affect patient management. As this study concerns routine diagnostic scans in nuclear medicine, no problems with patient recruitment are expected. Apart from the standard diagnostic PET/CT or SPECT/CT scan they have been referred for, eligible patients will undergo 4 additional quantitative PET or SPECT scans at different time points, covering the physical and physiological decay of the tracer. Scans will take from between 20–40 minutes, dependent on the level of activity remaining. Further radiopharmaceutical administrations will not be necessary. Data will be captured, anonymized and transferred to INSERM and UGENT for dosimetry calculations. Organ dose calculation will be performed using Monte-Carlo simulation techniques in models for the 25 patients, with a specific focus on the cardiac and chest region. Updated administered activity-to-dose conversion factors will be produced and compared with the currently used ICRP conversion factors. Relevant guidance documents for this clinical study include: ICRP Publication 128 and Lassmann et al 201123,24."</span></li>

Technical parameters (machine settings) on CT scans performed during the 5 additional years of follow-up will be collected from the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS), a system used to acquire, store and retrieve medical images in radiology departments. PerMoS a dedicated software has been implemented for the EPI-CT project in most participating hospitals and will be used for updated collection of data on scans. The strategy for individual organ dose reconstruction will follow the methodology developed as part of EPI-CT [45], which is based on NCICT, a Monte-Carlo simulation software developed to provide organ doses for the ICRP paediatric and adult reference hybrid phantoms [46]. Briefly, machines settings and other technical parameters, needed for organ dose calculation with NCICT, will be analysed using the two-dimensional Monte-Carlo simulation approach (2DMC) [47] to account for missing or uncertain data while maintaining correlations of doses for persons within subgroups with similar attributes (e.g. patients at particular hospitals, types of examination, time period). One thousand realizations of doses will be generated, at once, for all CT examinations performed in the participating hospitals and for each organ of interest (bone marrow, brain, breast, colon, hearth wall, eye lenses, salivary glands, thyroid). To do so, available sets of parameters will be used to derive probability density functions (PDFs), representing the range of possible true parameter values given that such data may be missing. For each calculation of a cohort dose distribution, values of parameters could be selected from the appropriate PDFs while maintaining proper correlations between parameters. In simulations, emphasis is put on estimating the dose for the entire cohort in order to maintain proper correlations among persons with similar (shared) attributes. Hence, we are using alternative realizations of possibly true sets of doses, each suitable for use in a dose-response as a surrogate of the true dose distribution."</span></li>

However, since the number of cases and controls is small compared to the number of participants in the full cohort study, individual specific information will be collected in collaboration with hospitals to reduce the uncertainties on dose estimates. Among the anticipated improvements is the access to individual anthropomorphic parameters for the cases and controls and the availability of an updated version of NCICT, which will allow adjustments of hybrid phantoms based on the height and weight of the patient at the time of exposure. Doses from other radiological procedures identified by questionnaire (and validated through medical records) and from Health Insurance records will be calculated using a similar approach. Technical information on radiological protocols used for the cases and controls will be searched in the PACS system, when possible. Additional information on typical technical parameters used for various radiology procedures, by age/weight category, will be obtained from published surveys, scientific publications or by interviewing experts (radiologist, technologists and medical physicist).<br />For each procedure, dose to bone marrow and brain will be estimated, together with associated uncertainties, using a Monte- Carlo simulation software. An option is PCXMC (A Monte-Carlo program for calculating patient doses in medical x-ray examinations) [48], developed in the 1990s and updated since to allow, among other improvements, automatic computation of doses. For consistency, the availability of a comparable software based on the ICRP paediatric and adult reference hybrid phantoms will be assessed prior to dose reconstruction. Such software is, to our knowledge, not available yet."</span></li>

Absorbed doses to normal organs, delivered from gamma-irradiation from source organs and from the passage of radioiodine through these organs, including marrow, kidneys and gut, cannot be determined directly. A comprehensive estimate of the total absorbed doses received by all organs requires in-depth analysis of the biokinetics of radioiodine [29,30]. Compartmental models developed to date have been concerned with dietary iodine intake and normal thyroid physiology and are applicable only to population models. For this task, computational models will be significantly extended. A comprehensive compartmental model will be developed for high activity radioiodine biokinetics following thyroidectomy that will incorporate the effects of treatment. Compartments will include thyroid remnants, plasma, gut and routes of excretion. Initial population mean rate constants will be determined from the patient blood samples (Task 3.4), whole-body retention measurements and, for the first time, quantitative I-131 image data. The effect of iodine on these values will then be investigated to determine the effect of compartmental irradiation on the kinetics of radioiodine and free iodide. This will establish the range of values and whether these are, in fact, not constant, in which case patient-specific rate variables may be determined. Computational compartmental modelling will be performed with the SAAM II software [31] to solve the linear differential equations. This model will be used with the dosimetry data obtained in Subtask 3.3 and the biomarker data obtained in Task 3.4 to determine the relationship between patient biokinetics and outcome data: success of ablation and short to mid-term toxicity, including sialadenitis, xerostomia and myelosuppression. This will provide early predictive biomarkers of treatment outcome that are not currently available and, in conjunction with the absorbed doses delivered to normal organs, will inform individualised treatment planning, whereby patients may be treated according the absorbed doses delivered, taking onto account risk estimates, rather than according to fixed administrations of activity. It is anticipated that this will be the subject of a separate clinical trial to be run under the auspices of the EANM. Results from this task will be fed at an early stage into Task 3.5 for initial development of an epidemiological study and will continue to inform development as further data become available and are analysed."</span></li>

During those processes, the radionuclide is said to undergo radioactive decay. [from wikipedia, citing R.H. Petrucci, W.S. Harwood and F.G.

Thus there is here no counterpart of ‘object’. In BFO 1.0 ‘process’ served as such a counterpart. In BFO 2.0 ‘process’ is, rather, the occurrent counterpart of ‘material entity’. Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay.

However, this does not mean that fiat object parts are dependent for their existence on divisions or delineations effected by cognitive subjects. If, for example, it is correct to conceive geological layers of the Earth as fiat object parts of the Earth, then even though these layers were first delineated in recent times, still existed long before such delineation and what holds of these layers (for example that the oldest layers are also the lowest layers) did not begin to hold because of our acts of delineation.Treatment of material entity in BFOExamples viewed by some as problematic cases for the trichotomy of fiat object part, object, and object aggregate include: a mussel on (and attached to) a rock, a slime mold, a pizza, a cloud, a galaxy, a railway train with engine and multiple carriages, a clonal stand of quaking aspen, a bacterial community (biofilm), a broken femur. Note that, as Aristotle already clearly recognized, such problematic cases – which lie at or near the penumbra of instances defined by the categories in question – need not invalidate these categories. The existence of grey objects does not prove that there are not objects which are black and objects which are white; the existence of mules does not prove that there are not objects which are donkeys and objects which are horses. It does, however, show that the examples in question need to be addressed carefully in order to show how they can be fitted into the proposed scheme, for example by recognizing additional subdivisions [29"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

Such units play a central role in almost all domains of natural science from particle physics to cosmology. Many scientific laws govern the units in question, employing general terms (such as ‘molecule’ or ‘planet’) referring to the types and subtypes of units, and also to the types and subtypes of the processes through which such units develop and interact. The division of reality into such natural units is at the heart of biological science, as also is the fact that these units may form higher-level units (as cells form multicellular organisms) and that they may also form aggregates of units, for example as cells form portions of tissue and organs form families, herds, breeds, species, and so on. At the same time, the division of certain portions of reality into engineered units (manufactured artifacts) is the basis of modern industrial technology, which rests on the distributed mass production of engineered parts through division of labor and on their assembly into larger, compound units such as cars and laptops. The division of portions of reality into units is one starting point for the phenomenon of counting."</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

Since dependent continuants cannot migrate from one independent continuant bearer to another, it follows that if b s-depends_on independent continuant c at some time, then b s-depends_on c at all times at which a exists. Inherence is in this sense redundantly time-indexed.For example, consider the particular instance of openness inhering in my mouth at t as I prepare to take a bite out of a donut, followed by a closedness at t+1 when I bite the donut and start chewing. The openness instance is then shortlived, and to say that it s-depends_on my mouth at all times at which this openness exists, means: at all times during this short life. Every time you make a fist, you make a new (instance of the universal) fist.
